## 3. Security Analysis

### 3.1 Current Security Weaknesses
- **Plain Text Storage**: All plugin settings stored in readable JSON
- **No Credential Management**: No secure storage for API keys/tokens
- **Vault Accessibility**: Settings files accessible to anyone with vault access
- **No Encryption**: Current implementation has no encryption layer

### 3.2 Web Crypto API Capabilities
```javascript
// Available Encryption Features
- AES-GCM (256-bit symmetric encryption)
- PBKDF2 (Password-based key derivation)
- RSA-OAEP (Asymmetric encryption)
- ECDH (Key exchange)
- HMAC (Message authentication)
```

### 3.3 Encryption Implementation Options

#### Option A: Password-Derived Encryption
```
Flow:
1. User provides master password
2. PBKDF2 derives encryption key from password + salt
3. AES-GCM encrypts API credentials
4. Store encrypted blob in plugin settings
5. Decrypt in memory only when needed

Pros: Strong encryption, user controls key
Cons: Password required each session, forgot password = data loss
```

#### Option B: Obsidian-Derived Encryption
```
Flow:
1. Generate encryption key from Obsidian vault ID + user ID
2. Store encrypted credentials in plugin settings
3. Auto-decrypt when plugin loads

Pros: No additional password needed
Cons: Less secure (predictable key source), vault compromise = credential exposure
```

### 3.4 Security Risk Assessment

#### HIGH RISK FACTORS
- **Credentials in Client**: API keys stored client-side regardless of encryption
- **Memory Exposure**: Decrypted tokens exist in JavaScript memory
- **Debug Access**: Obsidian's developer tools can access plugin memory
- **Backup Inclusion**: Encrypted credentials included in vault backups

#### MEDIUM RISK FACTORS
- **Local File Access**: Other applications on system could potentially access vault
- **Plugin Vulnerabilities**: Security flaws in plugin code could expose credentials
- **Obsidian Vulnerabilities**: Electron/Node.js security issues affect plugin

#### MITIGATION STRATEGIES
- **Short Token Lifespans**: Frequently refresh access tokens
- **Minimal Scope**: Request only necessary banking permissions
- **Memory Clearing**: Explicitly clear sensitive data from memory
- **Audit Logging**: Track all API access attempts

## 4. Regulatory Compliance Analysis

### 4.1 PSD2 Requirements for Third-Party Providers (TPP)

#### Registration Requirements
- **National Competent Authority**: Must register with financial regulator
- **QTSP Certificates**: Qualified certificates for API authentication
- **Professional Indemnity Insurance**: Financial coverage required
- **Operational Requirements**: Security standards, incident reporting

#### Technical Standards (RTS)
- **Common API Standards**: EBA technical standards compliance
- **SCA Implementation**: Strong customer authentication flows
- **Consent Management**: Explicit consent with clear scope/duration
- **Data Protection**: GDPR compliance for financial data

### 4.2 Obsidian Plugin Compliance Challenges

#### Regulatory Registration
- **Individual vs Corporate**: Personal projects cannot easily obtain TPP status
- **Insurance Requirements**: Professional indemnity insurance costly
- **Audit Requirements**: Regular security audits and reporting

#### Technical Compliance
- **Certificate Management**: QTSP certificates complex to obtain/manage
- **SCA Implementation**: Must support bank's SCA methods
- **Consent Management**: Complex UI/UX requirements for consent flows
